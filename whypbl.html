<h3>What's So Wrong With SBL?</h3>
<p>There are many reasons why Project Based learning came into existence, 
but the main one is the flawed learning system and long time enemy of PBL, 
Standards Based Learning.</p>
<p>Standards based learning is an outdated method of getting the point across 
for students designed to make students all learn the same thing like aimless 
robots.  These poor students are not getting any room to be creative, think 
innovatively, or quite frankly be individuals as a whole.</p>

<h3>Why PBL is Queen</h3>
<p>Hence the design of the reform that would change education forever, the new 
and improved Project Based Learning.  Out of the darkness of outdated standards 
emerges this much more efficient way to equip students with tools and information 
that they can really use in the real world, as well as teach them how to be creative 
with what they do.</p>
